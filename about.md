## About the website

This site was build from a template that I created
([github project](https://github.com/BenjaminHabert/jekyll-p5-portfolio)). This template
makes it easy to create and document simple projects like `p5.js` sketches. It is based
on the [Jekyll]((https://jekyllrb.com/)) theme [Minima]((https://github.com/jekyll/minima)).


## About me

31, French, currently working as a datascientist at [Quantmetry](https://www.quantmetry.com/).

I enjoy when beauty and complexity arise from simple rules.
