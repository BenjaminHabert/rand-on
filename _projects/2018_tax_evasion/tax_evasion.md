Red circles represent **taxable revenue** generated by
*__<span id="corp">corp</span>__* in a given city.
Click on a circle to know how much this company is contributing to the local economy.

{% include sketch.html file="tax.js" id="p5sketch"%}

This map contains no actual data about tax revenue. I relied on
[mappa.js](https://mappa.js.org/docs/getting-started.html) to synchronize
a [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) map with a
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/reference/) canvas. City positions
from mahemoff's [geodata](https://github.com/mahemoff/geodata) repository.
You can find the full source code below:

{% include code.html file="tax.js" %}



### Example of output

{% include gallery.html gallery="tax" %}
