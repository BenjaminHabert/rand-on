Try not to be hypnotized by the infinite recursive patterns.

{% include sketch.html file="recursive.js" id="p5sketch"%}

This is a response to the [Recursion Coding Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPsZwrV9ld0) suggested by Dan Shiffman.

In this variation we zoom in and out of the recursive pattern.

{% include code.html file="recursive.js" %}

### Example of output
{% include gallery.html gallery="recursive" %}
