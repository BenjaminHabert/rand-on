[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAja2jp1VjE) from the [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A) channel inspired me to create this interactive script.

Two identical layers of random white dots are overlapped on top of a dark background. When the top layer is rotated and shrunk slightly, [Moir√© patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern) arise. In this case, they take the shape of spirals.
